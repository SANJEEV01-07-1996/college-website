                  The department of Electrical Engineering was
                  started in the year 1949 when the institute was
                  born. The department offers four years B.Tech.
                  degree course with an annual intake of 100
                  students. Eighteen monthsâ€™ postgraduate program
                  is also offered leading to M.Tech. degree with
                  specialization in Control System and Power
                  System. The annual intake in the postgraduate
                  program is 10. The department is also looking after
                  an electrical sub-station and is maintaining a 14 Km
                  distribution line of BIT campus. The department
                  has well equipped laboratories required for
                  undergraduate and postgraduate programs. The
                  important laboratories include: Computer Lab,
                  Control System Lab, Microprocessor Lab, Electrical
                  Machines Lab, Instrumentation Lab, Circuit Lab,
                  High Voltage Lab and Electrical Workshop. The
                  prestigious million volt Atkinson High Tension
                  Laboratory of the department is considered as first
                  of its kind in India in the yesteryears.
