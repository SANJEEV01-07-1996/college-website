                  The department of Mechanical Engineering was
                  started in the year 1949 when the institute was
                  born. The department offers four years B.Tech
                  degree course with an annual intake of 105
                  students. The two year postgraduate program is
                  also offered leading to M.Tech degree course with
                  specialization in Heat Power Engineering, machine
                  Design and Production Technology. The annual
                  intake in the postgraduate program is 75.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The department has well equipped laboratories
                  required for undergraduate & post graduate
                  programs. The important laboratories include:
                  Strength of Materials, Applied Mechanics, Heat
                  Engine, Hydraulics, Aerodynamics, Heat and Mass
                  Transfer, Solar Energy, Tribology, Industrial
                  Engineering Lab etc. The department has a huge
                  workshop consisting of various units like
                  Carpentry, Smithy, foundry, Machine Shop etc.
