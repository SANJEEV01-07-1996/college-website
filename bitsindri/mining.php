                  The Department of Mining Engineering, BIT Sindri was started in the
                  year 1975 by the Government of Bihar, keeping in view the vast and
                  a large variety of mineral reserves in the state of Bihar (now
                  Jharkhand). There was also an urgency to cater the need for a large
                  number of trained and skilled mining engineers in the 1970s as
                  natural consequences of nationalization of the mineral industries.
                  The department was started with an initial intake of 25 students in
                  four years’ degree course which was subsequently approved off late
                  enhancing to 49 students per year by AICTE, New Delhi
